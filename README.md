## Description
Option Analyzer was created as an alternative to existing calculators that force the user to edit a form each time they change the strike price or expiration date of an stock option. To view the difference between a $150 and $151 call option, it would take 3-4 button taps as well as a navigation away from the graph. All of this makes it hard to visualize subtle differences. 

What makes Option Analyzer completely unique is that it allows you to view  option strike prices and expirations in a menu while showing the graph at the same time. As you scroll through different strike prices, the graph will update in real-time! 

Option Analyzer shows expected return on any given day, at any given strike price. 

Configure simple or complex options strategies and view estimated value at different underlying prices at individual days leading up to expiration.

Option Analyzer has multiple graph modes available so that you can view option spread value, profit, percent of cost, or percent gain. 

Option Analyzer uses the Black Scholes model to determine estimated values.
